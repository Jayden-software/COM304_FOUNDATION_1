Within my past experiences I have developed a strong foundation specifically within the sector of hardware and this includes understanding the specifications of what is in a computer such as the Central Processing Unit (CPU), moreover, the dedicated RAM speeds such as DDR4/DDR5 and the speed within Mhz. In addition, I have experience within Microsoft 365 including Excel due to me studying a Business course and it helped me understand how to create different graphs. From this module i would like to understand how programming languages work and undertsand the fundamental foundation of how to write code. In addition, I would like to add depth into my knowledge of computer components and hardware. 

My first ever computer devicde was a dell optiplex, speciofications include the following:
-Central Processing Unit (I7 870)

-4GB DDR3 memroy/RAM

-Windows 7

My first ever phone was an andriod specifically a lenovo. 

This is where i built and developed an interest within technology of wondering how it wors from the theorys to practical's. I also had a Macbook but ran into numerous of issues within my experience. This issue was having a corrupt MascOS, leading to me learning how to go into the utility disk and this then led me to encounter my first troubleshoot, at first I was confused however i soon did a Google search and learnt how to diagmoise and troubleshoot the issue and this then resolved the corrupted file by reinstalling MacOS in a new disk drive. Furthermore, this issue made me defer from using MacOS any longer and switched back to Windows and ever since I have not ran into any issues. 

TBD
