# Session 1

## Topics covered
*What topics were covered in this session*

 -Intorduction of Github,  
 
 -Notable historic figures (Alen Turing, Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage)

 -Thoeretical foundation of hardware/components (CPU, Memnory, Peripherals)

 -Different types of computers (Analogue, Digital, Electronic)
 
 -Transistors and integrational circuits


## Personal Notes and research following this session
*Which class sessions and personal research refers to technology in this proposal. Link to examples.*

(Personal notations)
-Transistors are the preconditioned factor that sustains integrated circuits and microchips, accredited at (“What’s a Transistor and How Does It Work? | Imec”), 
in short they are electornic switches.

-Integrational circuits is a tiny electronic device that merges numerous of different components such as resistors, transistors, and capacitors within a semiconductor chip. Over 5 decades IC's have achieved much greater speeds, greatere capacity whilst still maintaining a small size, modern day IC's have become very complex and are now able to accomodate billions of transistors, overseen at, (Foster).

-Both of these hardwares intertwine with one another and fall under the topic of Theoretical foundation of components.
