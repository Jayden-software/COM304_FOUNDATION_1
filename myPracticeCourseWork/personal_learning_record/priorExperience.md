Within my past experiences I have developed a strong foundation specifically within the sector of hardware and this includes understanding the specifications of what is in a computer such as the Central Processing Unit (CPU), moreover, the dedicated RAM speeds such as DDR4/DDR5 and the speed within Mhz. In addition, I have experience within Microsoft 365 including Excel due to me studying a Business course and it helped me understand how to create different graphs. From this module i would like to understand how programming languages work and undertsand the fundamental foundation of how to write code. In addition, I would like to add depth into my knowledge of computer components and hardware.
