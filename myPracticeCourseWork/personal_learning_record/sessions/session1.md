*Which class sessions and personal research refers to technology in this proposal. Link to examples.*

(Personal notations)
-Transistors are the preconditioned factor that sustains integrated circuits and microchips, accredited at (“What’s a Transistor and How Does It Work? | Imec”), 
in short they are electornic switches. Therefore, it results in the transistor being amplifilers in which are then able to write 1 and 0s. Now 1 and 0s is the key funademental to all of and everything related to digital information, it processes everything that a computer demonstrates within two state's on (1) off (0) within the central processessing unit (CPU) and RAM system. overseen at, (Awati). In short, it conveys all the data within a certain machine through a readable format. 

Linking back to hardware - the newer the generation of the CPU that a system has will have more advanced transistors leading to advantages such as 
-Better power efficiency (lower wattage)
-Improvements upon the speed of the CPU specifically clockspeed (Ghz)
-Increaased transistor density allowing for more profound complex calculations 
-Greater parrallel processing (breaking down computational problems into smaller parts whilst simulatenously executing them), accredited at, (Icodewithben).

-Integrational circuits is a tiny electronic device that merges numerous of different components such as resistors, transistors, and capacitors within a semiconductor chip. Over 5 decades IC's have achieved much greater speeds, greatere capacity whilst still maintaining a small size, modern day IC's have become very complex and are now able to accomodate billions of transistors, overseen at, (Foster).

-Both of these hardwares intertwine with one another and fall under the topic of Theoretical foundation of components.

-Different types of computers (Analogue and Digital). Analogue uses electircal circuits of which fall under physical mechanics to modlel and create a solution for the mathematical problem whereas Digital computers uses discrete binary code such as 1 and 0s. For data collection, analogue uses non=discrete signals that portray real world occurence however digital uses a much more efficient and accurate way by using binary code. Overseen at, (“Analog vs Digital Computers: Key Differences Explained with Examples | Educatly”).

The cloud, in short this is a hidden netwrok that restores, retains and process data from a laptop, phone or home pc. Moreover, the cloud is usually in a remote location in which can be anywhere within the world, all of this is done via a cloud provider and an internmet connection.
